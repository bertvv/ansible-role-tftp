# Ansible role `tftp`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-tftp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertvv/ansible-role-tftp)

An Ansible role for installing a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server on RHEL/CentOS 7. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- install the necessary packages
- manage the configuration
- manage SELinux settings

For more relevant documentation on TFTP, see:

- [`tftpd(8)` man page](http://linuxmanpages.net/manpages/fedora21/man8/tftpd.8.html)
- [`tftp_selinux(8)` man page](http://linuxmanpages.net/manpages/fedora21/man8/tftpd_selinux.8.html)

## Requirements

none.

## Role Variables

The following variables can be set by the administrator:

| Variable                      | Default                              | Comments (type)                                                |

| `tftp_home_dir`               | false                                | Boolean that specifies whether SELinux                         |

## Dependencies

No dependencies.

## Example Playbook

See the [test playbook](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-tftp/blob/tests/test.yml)

## Testing

Tests for this role are provided in the form of a Vagrant environment that is kept in a separate branch, [tests](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-tftp/tree/tests). I use [git-worktree(1)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to include the test code into the working directory. Instructions for running the tests:

1. Fetch the tests branch: `git fetch origin tests`
2. Create a Git worktree for the test code: `git worktree add tests tests` (remark: this requires at least Git v2.5.0). This will create a directory `tests/`.
3. `cd tests/`
4. `vagrant up` will then create a VM and apply the second of the two available testing playbooks enumerated below.

The test playbooks:

- [`test-minimal.yml`](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-tftp/blob/vagrant-tests/test-minimal.yml) applies the role to a VM, with default settings (no role variables are set).
- [`test.yml`](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-tftp/blob/vagrant-tests/test.yml) applies the role to a VM, changing some default values. The playbook also puts a file named README into the TFTP root directory. After applying this playbook, you should be able to fetch that file from your host system (assuming the `tftp` client is installed):

  ```ShellSession
  $ tftp 127.0.0.1 6969 -c get README
  ```

The TFTP port (69) on the VM is forwarded through the NAT interface to port 6969 on your host system, hence the 127.0.0.1 and port number in the command line.
